Augments and polyfills the html5 placeholder attribute. 

When you focus a field it keeps the placeholder text until you start typing. This keeps users from forgetting what the field is before they start typing.

Usage: 
# include js
# add placeholder attribute to fields you want
# invoke plugin with `window.initPlaceholder()`

Note: I've not updated this in a while so I'm not sure if browser support is up to 2013 standards. Feel free to contribute.
